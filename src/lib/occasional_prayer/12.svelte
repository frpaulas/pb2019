<TextBlock>
	Almighty and everlasting God, you govern all things in heaven and on earth: Mercifully hear our
	prayers, and grant that in this Congregation the pure Word of God may be preached and the
	Sacraments duly administered. Strengthen and confirm the faithful; protect and guide the children;
	visit and relieve the sick; turn and soften the wicked; arouse the careless; recover the fallen;
	restore the penitent; remove all hindrances to the advancement of your truth; and bring us all to
	be of one heart and mind within your holy Church, to the honor and glory of your Name; through
	Jesus Christ our Lord. **Amen.**
