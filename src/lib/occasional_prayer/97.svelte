<TextBlock>
	Holy Spirit, breath of God and fire of love, I cannot pray without your aid: Kindle in me the fire
	of your love, and illumine me with your light; that with a steadfast will and holy thoughts I may
	approach the Father in spirit and in truth; through Jesus Christ my Lord, who reigns with you and
	the Father in eternal union. **Amen.**
