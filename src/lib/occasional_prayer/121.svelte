<TextBlock>
	O God, who created all peoples in your image: We thank you for the diversity of races and cultures
	in this world. Show us your presence in those who differ from us, and enrich our lives with their
	fellowship, until our knowledge of your love is made perfect in our love for all your children;
	through Jesus Christ our Lord. **Amen.**
