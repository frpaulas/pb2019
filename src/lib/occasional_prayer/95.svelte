<SectionTitle>95. in times of suffering or weakness</SectionTitle>
<TextBlock>
	Dear Lord and Savior Jesus Christ: I hold up all my weakness to your strength, my failure to your
	faithfulness, my sinfulness to your perfection, my loneliness to your compassion, my little pains
	to your great agony on the Cross. I pray that you will cleanse me, strengthen me, guide me, so
	that in all ways my life may be lived as you would have it lived, without cowardice and for you
	alone. Show me how to live in true humility, true contrition, and true love. **Amen.**
