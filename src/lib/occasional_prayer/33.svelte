<TextBlock>
	O God, the Creator of all, whose Son commanded us to love our enemies: Lead them and us from
	prejudice to truth; deliver them and us from hatred, cruelty, and revenge; and in your good time
	enable us all to stand reconciled before you in Jesus Christ; in whose Name we pray. **Amen.**
