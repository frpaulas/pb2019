	Gracious and everliving Father, you have given the Holy Spirit to abide with us for ever: Bless,
	we pray, with the Holy Spirit’s grace and presence, the Bishop(s), Priests, Deacons, and all the
	Laity who assemble in your Name; that your Church, being preserved in true faith and godly
	discipline, may fulfill the will of him who loved her and gave himself for her, your Son Jesus
	Christ our Savior; who now lives and reigns with you and the same Spirit, one God, now and for
	ever. **Amen.**
