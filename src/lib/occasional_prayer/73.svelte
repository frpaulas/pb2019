	Almighty and eternal God, so draw our hearts to you, so guide our minds, so fill our imaginations,
	so control our wills, that we may be wholly yours, utterly dedicated to you; and then use us, we
	pray, as you will, and always to your glory and the welfare of your people; through our Lord and
	Savior Jesus Christ. **Amen.**
