<SectionTitle>123. for deliverance from peril</SectionTitle>
<TextBlock>
	Almighty God, our strong tower of defense in time of trouble: We offer you praise and heartfelt
	thanks for our deliverance from the dangers which lately surrounded us [and for your gracious gift
	of peace]. We confess that your goodness alone has preserved us; and we ask you still to continue
	your mercies toward us, that we may always know and acknowledge you as our Savior and mighty
	Deliverer; through Jesus Christ our Lord. **Amen.**
