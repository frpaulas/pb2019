<SectionTitle>41. for cities, towns, and other communities</SectionTitle>
<TextBlock>
	Heavenly Father, you sent your Son among us to proclaim the kingdom of God in cities, towns,
	villages, and lonely places. Behold and visit, we pray, the community of ________. Renew the bonds
	of charity that uphold our civic life. Send us honest and able leaders. Deliver us from poverty,
	prejudice, and oppression, that peace may prevail with righteousness, and justice with mercy. And
	at the last, bring us to your Holy City, the new Jerusalem, where we shall know perfect unity and
	peace; through Jesus Christ our Lord. **Amen.**
