<TextBlock>
	Almighty God, by your Word you laid the foundations of the earth, set the bounds of the sea, and
	still the wind and waves. Surround us with your grace and peace, and preserve us through this
	storm [or ________]. By your Spirit, lift up those who have fallen, strengthen those who work to
	rescue or rebuild, and fill us with the hope of your new creation; through Jesus Christ our Lord.
	**Amen.**
