	Finished and perfected is the mystery of thy dispensation to us, O Christ our God: For we have
	beheld the likeness of thy death, we have seen thy resurrection in the breaking of the bread, and
	we have partaken of thine inexhaustible and divine delights, of which do thou make us worthy, both
	now and in thy kingdom and unto the ages of ages. **Amen.**
