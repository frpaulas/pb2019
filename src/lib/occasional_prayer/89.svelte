<TextBlock>
	Teach me to seek you, and as I seek you, show yourself to me; for I cannot seek you unless you
	show me how, and I will never find you unless you show yourself to me. Let me seek you by desiring
	you, and desire you by seeking you; let me find you by loving you, and love you in finding you.
	**Amen.**
