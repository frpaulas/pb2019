<TextBlock>
	O God of the spirits of all flesh, we praise and magnify thy holy Name for all thy servants who
	have finished their course in thy faith and fear [especially thy servant N.]; and we beseech thee
	that, encouraged by their examples and strengthened by their fellowship, we also may be found meet
	to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light; through the merits of thy Son Jesus
	Christ our Lord. **Amen.**
