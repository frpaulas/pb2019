	O heavenly Father, you have filled the world with beauty: Open our eyes to behold your gracious
	hand in all your works; that, rejoicing in your whole creation, we may learn to serve you with
	gladness; for the sake of him through whom all things were made, your Son Jesus Christ our Lord.
	**Amen.**
