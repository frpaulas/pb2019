<TextBlock>
	Almighty God, you created us in your own image: Grant us grace to contend fearlessly against evil
	and to make no peace with oppression; and help us to use our freedom rightly in the establishment
	of justice in our communities and among the nations, to the glory of your holy Name; through Jesus
	Christ our Lord, who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, now and for ever.
	**Amen.**
