<TextBlock>
	O Lord Jesus Christ, in this wonderful Sacrament you have given us a memorial of your passion:
	Grant us, we pray, so to venerate the sacred mysteries of your Body and Blood, that we may ever
	perceive within ourselves the fruit of your redemption; who live and reign with the Father and the
	Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and ever. **Amen.**
