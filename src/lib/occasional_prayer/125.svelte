<TextBlock>
	We give thanks to you, O Lord our God, for all your servants and witnesses of time past: for
	Abraham, the father of believers, and Sarah his wife; for Moses, the lawgiver, and Aaron, the
	priest; for Miriam and Joshua, Deborah and Gideon, and Samuel with Hannah his mother; for David,
	King over Israel; for Isaiah and all the prophets; for Mary, the mother of our Lord; for Peter and
	Paul and all the apostles; for Mary and Martha, and Mary Magdalene; for Stephen, the first martyr,
	and all the martyrs and saints in every age and in every land. In your mercy, O Lord our God, give
	us, as you gave to them, the hope of salvation and the promise of eternal life; through Jesus
	Christ our Lord, the first‑born of many from the dead. **Amen.**
