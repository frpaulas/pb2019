<TextBlock>
	O Judge of the nations, we thank you with grateful hearts for the men and women of our country who
	in the day of decision ventured much for the liberties we now enjoy. Grant that we may not rest
	until all the people of this land share the benefits of true freedom and gladly accept its
	disciplines. This we ask in the Name of Jesus Christ our Lord. **Amen.**
