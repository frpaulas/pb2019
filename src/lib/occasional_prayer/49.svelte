<SectionTitle>49. for schools, colleges, and universities</SectionTitle>
<TextBlock>
	Almighty God, by your gift alone we come to wisdom and true understanding: Look with favor, we
	pray, on our universities, colleges, and schools, [especially ________,] that knowledge may be
	increased among us, and wholesome learning flourish and abound. Bless those who teach and those
	who learn; and grant that in humility of heart they may ever look to you, the fountain of all
	wisdom; through Jesus Christ our Lord. **Amen.**
