<SectionTitle>45. for those who serve others</SectionTitle>
<TextBlock>
	O Lord our heavenly Father, whose blessed Son came not to be served, but to serve: We ask you to
	bless all who, following in his steps, give themselves to the service of others [especially
	_________]; endue them with wisdom, patience, and courage, that they may strengthen the weak and
	raise up those who fall, and, being inspired by your love, may worthily minister to the suffering,
	the friendless, and the needy; for the sake of him who laid down his life for us, your Son our
	Savior Jesus Christ. **Amen.**
