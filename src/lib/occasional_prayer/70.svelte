<TextBlock>
	Gracious God and most merciful Father, you have granted us the rich and precious jewel of your
	holy Word: Assist us with your Spirit, that the same Word may be written in our hearts to our
	everlasting comfort, to reform us, to renew us according to your own image, to build us up and
	edify us into the perfect dwelling place of your Christ, sanctifying and increasing in us all
	heavenly virtues; grant this, O heavenly Father, for Jesus Christ’s sake. **Amen.**
