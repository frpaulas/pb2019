	Thanks be to thee, my Lord Jesus Christ, for all the pains and insults thou hast borne for me, and
	all the benefits thou hast given me. O most merciful Redeemer, Friend, and Brother: Grant that I
	may see thee more clearly, love thee more dearly, and follow thee more nearly, day by day.
	**Amen.**
