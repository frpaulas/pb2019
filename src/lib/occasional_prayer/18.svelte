<TextBlock>
	Lord Jesus, you commanded us to make disciples of all nations: Bless all those who work together
	for the spread of the Gospel [especially __________]; make them faithful and true witnesses to
	proclaim your glorious Name. Send down the grace of the Holy Spirit upon all your people, that we
	may give cheerfully of our substance for the evangelization of the world, and that the light of
	your truth may shine brightly in every place. Hear us, O merciful Savior, who with the Father and
	the Holy Spirit live and reign, one God, world without end. **Amen.**
