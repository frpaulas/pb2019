<SectionTitle>42. for the human family</SectionTitle>
<TextBlock>
	O God, you made us in your own image, and you have redeemed us through your Son Jesus Christ: Look
	with compassion on the whole human family; take away the arrogance and hatred which infect our
	hearts; break down the walls that separate us; unite us in bonds of love; and work through our
	struggle and confusion to accomplish your purposes on earth; that, in your good time, all nations
	and races may serve you in harmony around your heavenly throne; through Jesus Christ our Lord.
	**Amen.**
