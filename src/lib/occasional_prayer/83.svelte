<SectionTitle>83. in the morning</SectionTitle>
<TextBlock>
	Almighty God, you alone gave us the breath of life, and you alone can keep alive in us the holy
	desires you impart. We beseech you, for your compassion’s sake, to sanctify all our thoughts and
	endeavors, that we may neither begin an action without a pure intention nor continue it without
	your blessing. And grant that, having the eyes of our mind enlightened to behold things invisible
	and unseen, we may in heart be inspired by your wisdom, in work be upheld by your strength, and in
	the end be accepted as your faithful servants; through Jesus Christ our Savior. **Amen.**
