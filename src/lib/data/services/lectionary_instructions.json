Thus, Advent 2019 begins a new cycle with Year A. Multiple sets of lessons are assigned for Christmas Day, Easter Day, and All Saints’ Day. Also included are single sets of readings for all other Prayer Book Principal Feasts and Holy Days (Red-Letter Days), including Ash Wednesday and the days of Holy Week and Easter Week. Lessons for Ember Days, Rogation Days, National Days, and Commemorations (Black-Letter Days) are appointed as well."

The English Standard Version of the Scriptures is the normative text; however, the Psalms should be read or sung in a version intended for that purpose.The Bishop of the Diocese is to be consulted where a regular pattern of fewer than four lessons is adopted as the Sunday customary of a Congregation, or when a pattern of alternate readings or a “sermon series” is proposed. The rector of a Congregation may direct that an appointed lesson be shortened or lengthened, provided the plain sense is retained."
