Anglicanism at the time of the Reformation established that the entire Psalter should be read in the Daily Office every month. This one-month cycle is printed on the following page, and is indicated within the Psalter itself."

Proper psalms for the feasts of Epiphany, the Presentation, the Annunciation, the Transfiguration, All Saints’, and Christmas have been included within the sixty-day psalm cycle."

						"text": "For any day, the psalms appointed may be reduced in number according to local circumstance, provided that the entire Psalter is read regularly. If only one Office is prayed in a day, any of the psalms appointed for that day may be used. The Gloria Patri (Glory be...) may be said after each psalm, or at the conclusion of all the psalms of the Office. The manner of recitation of the psalms can be adapted to size of Congregation and physical setting: responsive (between leader and people), antiphonal (alternating sides of the Congregation), or in unison, and by whole or half verse. For purposes of reflective pause, half-verse recitation, or musical chant, the asterisk (*) printed in each verse indicates the place where the verse divides."

					},
					{
						"type": "text_block",
						"text": "The first lesson is normally taken from the Old Testament or the Apocrypha. The Old Testament is read in its entirety once each year (with the exception of a few passages in Leviticus, Numbers, Joshua, Judges, Ezra, Nehemiah, Ezekiel, and the majority of Chronicles). These readings may be shortened if necessary, as long as the plain sense of the text is not lost. The dagger symbol (†) indicates a way to abbreviate a longer chapter if desired. The Gospels and Acts are read in their entirety twice each year, at Morning Prayer during the first part of the year, at Evening Prayer during the second part of the year. The Epistles are read twice each year in the opposite pattern, except for the Revelation to John, which is read only once, during the Advent season. Less of the Apocrypha has been included than in the 1662 Book of Common Prayer; however, select passages have been retained, in keeping with the classic Anglican principle that “the Church doth read [these books] for example of life and instruction of manners; but yet doth it not apply them to establish any doctrine” (Article VI of the Thirty-Nine Articles)."
					},
					{
						"type": "text_block",
						"text": "In general, readings move continuously through books of the Bible, interrupted only by Holy Days. For most Holy Days a single proper lesson is included, usually in Morning Prayer. For major feasts of our Lord, two proper lessons are included. The Holy Days connected to the date of Easter (Ash Wednesday, Maundy Thursday, Good Friday, Holy Saturday, Easter Day, Ascension, and Pentecost) have a variable calendar date year to year. Proper readings for these days are provided in additional tables in the midst of the lectionary, and are indicated at the earliest possible date with a double dagger (‡)."

On other Holy Days, the psalm and lessons from the sunday, holy day, and com- memoration lectionary may be used, if those lessons are not to be used at a celebration of the Eucharist on that day."

It is appropriate to conclude readings from the Apocrypha with “Here ends the Reading.” Should an alternate reading be desired to replace the Apocrypha, the reading appointed as the first lesson of the other Office for that day may be divided between the two Offices."

						"type": "text_block",
						"text": "This Daily Office Lectionary may be adapted for use in a two- year cycle (indicated by I and II in the monthly headings) by reading only the two lessons appointed for Morning Prayer in odd-numbered years (e.g., 2019) and the two lessons appointed for Evening Prayer in even-numbered years (e.g., 2020). The two lessons each day may be divided across the two Offices. In this way, the New Testament will be read through once each year, and the Old Testament will be read through in two years."
