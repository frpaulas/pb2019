    button::text (create place holder button, text = text for button)

footnote: footnote text usage-> footnote: text

l: line usage-> l:text (supports multiline with indented continuation)

lords_prayer: insert the Lord's Prayer

pb: page break usage-> pb:n (pb:n indicates the beginning of page n)

pg: pages usage-> pg:n | pg:n-n (must be first line in file)

r: rubric usage-> r:text (supports multiline with indented continuation)

ref: biblical_reference
ref+: biblical_reference:additional_text

global arguments:
    b: make the text bold
    o: text is optional, gets left hand border
    i: indent

MULTILINE CONTINUATION:
    For directives that support multiple lines (r, tb, l), continuation lines
    must start with whitespace (space or tab). This makes the structure visually
    clear and prevents accidental continuation.

    Example:
        tb: This is a long prayer that
          continues on the next line
          and the line after that.

    Continuation lines are indented (typically 2 spaces) to show they belong to
    the previous directive. Any line starting at column 0 is treated as a new
    directive. The linter will error if a continuation line is not indented.


I see that rubric and text_block already use `parsePageLinks`. I need to integrate the wrapper parsing with that. Let me update `parsePageLinks` to also handle wrappers:

dpb to json conversion
for file in src/lib/data/services/dpb/*.dpb; do    node scripts/convert-raw-to-json.cjs "$file"; done

build service pagesnode scripts/build-service-pages.cjs
