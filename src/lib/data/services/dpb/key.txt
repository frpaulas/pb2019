MULTILINE CONTINUATION:
    For directives that support multiple lines (r, tb, l), continuation lines
    must start with whitespace (space or tab). This makes the structure visually
    clear and prevents accidental continuation.

    Example:
        tb: This is a long prayer that
          continues on the next line
          and the line after that.

    Continuation lines are indented (typically 2 spaces) to show they belong to
    the previous directive. Any line starting at column 0 is treated as a new
    directive. The linter will error if a continuation line is not indented.


I see that rubric and text_block already use `parsePageLinks`. I need to integrate the wrapper parsing with that. Let me update `parsePageLinks` to also handle wrappers:

dpb to json conversion
for file in src/lib/data/services/dpb/*.dpb; do    node scripts/convert-raw-to-json.cjs "$file"; done

build service pagesnode scripts/build-service-pages.cjs
