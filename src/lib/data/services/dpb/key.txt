button: add button usage->
    button:link: text (create button with link to location in DPB, text = text for button)
    button::text (create place holder button, text = text for button)

footnote: footnote text usage-> footnote: text

l: line usage-> l:text (single line or use \ for continuation)

lords_prayer: insert the Lord's Prayer

pb: page break usage-> pb:n (pb:n indicates the beginning of page n)

pg: pages usage-> pg:n | pg:n-n (must be first line in file)

r: rubric usage-> r:text (use \ at end of line to continue on next line)

ref: biblical_reference
ref+: biblical_reference:additional_text

scripture: scripture verse usage-> scripture:reference::text

st: section title usage-> st: text | st:(1|2|3): text (where 1,2,3 indicates relative text size)

tb: text block usage-> tb: text (use \ at end of line to continue on next line)

tp: title page usage-> tp:text

use: include directive usage-> use:type:name

v: versical usage->
    v::text (no speaker)
    v:b: (no speaker, bold text)
    v:speaker:text (speaker proceeds text, bold if speaker is "people")

global arguments:
    b: make the text bold
    o: text is optional, gets left hand border
    i: indent

MULTILINE CONTINUATION:
    For directives that support multiple lines (r, tb, l), use backslash (\) at the
    end of each line that continues to the next line.

    Example:
        tb: This is a long prayer that \
        continues on the next line \
        and the line after that.

    Without the backslash, the next line will be treated as a new directive.
    The linter will error if a line appears to be a continuation but lacks \


I see that rubric and text_block already use `parsePageLinks`. I need to integrate the wrapper parsing with that. Let me update `parsePageLinks` to also handle wrappers:

dpb to json conversion
for file in src/lib/data/services/dpb/*.dpb; do    node scripts/convert-raw-to-json.cjs "$file"; done

build service pagesnode scripts/build-service-pages.cjs
