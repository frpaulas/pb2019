st: the presentation, exhortation and examination

r: Only a Bishop may confirm. The Bishop customarily sits in a chair in front of the Altar
Table. The Candidates and Presenters stand facing the Bishop as their Presenters say

v:presenters: Reverend Father in God, we present these persons to receive the laying on of hands.
v:bishop: Have they been adequately prepared?
v:presenters: They have.
r: The Bishop then says

tb: Dearly beloved, it is essential that those who wish to be
Confirmed or Received in this Church publicly confess Jesus
Christ as their Lord and Savior; become his disciples; know
and affirm the Nicene Creed, the Lord’s Prayer, and the Ten
Commandments; and have received instruction in the Holy
Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments and the Catechism of
the Church. God’s grace is imparted in Baptism, through which
we are made God’s children by adoption and given the Holy
Spirit. By the power of the Spirit, manifested in gifts and fruit, we
are enabled to be God’s people for the sake of the world.

tb: Now, _these Candidates desire_ publicly to confess _their_ faith in Jesus
Christ as Savior and _their_ commitment to follow him as Lord.
_They_ also _desire_ the strengthening of grace through the laying on
of hands, that the Holy Spirit may _fill_ them more and more for
_their_ ministry in the Church and in the world.

r: The Bishop then addresses the Candidates

v: Do you, here in the presence of God and the Church,
v: renew the solemn promises and vows made at your
v: and commit to keep them?

pb:177
v:candidates: I do.

v:bishop: Do you renounce the devil and all the spiritual forces
v: of wickedness that rebel against God?

v:candidates I renounce them.

v:bishop: Do you renounce the empty promises and deadly
v: deceits of this world that corrupt and destroy the
v: creatures of God?

v:candidates: I renounce them.

v:bishop: Do you renounce the sinful desires of the flesh that
v: draw you from the love of God?

v:candidates: I renounce them.

v:bishop: Do you turn to Jesus Christ and confess him as your Lord and Savior?

v:candidates: I do.

v:bishop: Do you joyfully receive the Christian Faith, as
v: revealed in the Holy Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments?

v:candidates: I do.

v:bishop: Will you obediently keep God’s holy will and commandments,
v: and walk in them all the days of your life?

v:candidates: I will, the Lord being my helper.

r: The Bishop addresses the Congregation, saying

tb: Will you who witness these vows do all in your power to
support these persons in their life in Christ?
