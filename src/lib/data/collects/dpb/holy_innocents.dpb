st: the holy innocents{br}_December 28_
tb: Almighty God, out of the mouths of children you manifest your truth, and by the death of the
    Holy Innocents at the hands of evil tyrants you show your strength in our weakness: We ask you
    to mortify all that is evil within us, and so strengthen us by your grace, that we may glorify
    your holy Name by the innocence of our lives and the constancy of our faith even unto death;
    through Jesus Christ our Lord, who died for us and now lives with you and the Holy Spirit,
    world without end. **Amen.**
