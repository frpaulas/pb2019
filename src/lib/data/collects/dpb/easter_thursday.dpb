st: thursday of easter week
tb: Almighty God, you show those in error the light of your truth so that they may turn to the path
    of righteousness: Grant that all who have been reborn into the fellowship of Christ’s Body may
    show forth in their lives what they profess by their faith; through Jesus Christ our Lord, who
    lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, now and for ever. **Amen.**
