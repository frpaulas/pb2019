tb: Almighty God, by the hand of Mark the evangelist you have given to your Church the Gospel of
    Jesus Christ: We thank you for his witness, and pray that you will give us grace to know the
    truth, and not to be carried about by every wind of false doctrine, that we may know Jesus
    Christ as our Lord and Savior; who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, for
    ever and ever. **Amen.**
