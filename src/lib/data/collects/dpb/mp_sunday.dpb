st: a collect for strength to await christ's return
st: _Sunday_
tb: O God our King, by the resurrection of your Son Jesus Christ on the first day of the week, you
    conquered sin, put death to flight, and gave us the hope of everlasting life: Redeem all our
    days by this victory; forgive our sins, banish our fears, make us bold to praise you and to do
    your will; and steel us to wait for the consummation of your kingdom on the last great Day;
    through Jesus Christ our Lord.
