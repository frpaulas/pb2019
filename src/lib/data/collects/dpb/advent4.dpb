st: the fourth sunday in advent
st: _Annunciation_
tb: Stir up your power, O Lord, and with great might come among us; and as we are sorely hindered
    by our sins from running the race that is set before us, let your bountiful grace and mercy
    speedily help and deliver us; through Jesus Christ our Lord, to whom, with you and the Holy
    Spirit, be honor and glory, now and for ever. **Amen.**
