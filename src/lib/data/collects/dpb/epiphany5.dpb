tb: O Lord, our heavenly Father, keep your household the Church continually in your true religion,
    that we who trust in the hope of your heavenly grace may always be defended by your mighty
    power; through Jesus Christ our Lord, who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, now
    and for ever. **Amen.**
