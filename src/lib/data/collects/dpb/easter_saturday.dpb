tb: Heavenly Father, you have delivered us from the dominion of sin and death, and brought us into
    the kingdom of your beloved Son: Grant that, as by his death he has called us to life, so by
    his love he may raise us to eternal joys; who lives and reigns with you, in the unity of the
    Holy Spirit, one God, now and for ever. **Amen.**
