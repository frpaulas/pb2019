tb: O God, your blessed Son became poor for our sake, and chose the Cross over the kingdoms of this
    world: Deliver us from an inordinate love of worldly things, that we, inspired by the devotion
    of your servant N., may seek you with singleness of heart, behold your glory by faith, and
    attain to the riches of your everlasting kingdom, where we shall be united with our Savior
    Jesus Christ; who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, now and for ever.
    **Amen.**
