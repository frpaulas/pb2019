st: _Canada and United States of America_
tb: Most merciful Father, we humbly thank you for all your gifts so freely bestowed upon us: for
    life and health and safety, for strength to work and leisure to rest, for all that is beautiful
    in creation and in human life; but above all we thank you for our spiritual mercies in Christ
    Jesus our Lord; who with you and the Holy Spirit lives and reigns, one God, for ever and ever.
    **Amen.**
