st: the first sunday of epiphany{br}_The Baptism of Our Lord_
tb: Eternal Father, at the baptism of Jesus you revealed him to be your Son, and your Holy Spirit
    descended upon him like a dove: Grant that we, who are born again by water and the Spirit, may
    be faithful as your adopted children; through Jesus Christ our Lord, who lives and reigns with
    you and the Holy Spirit, one God, now and for ever. **Amen.**
