tb: Almighty and everlasting God, you gave your apostle Bartholomew grace truly to believe and to
    preach your Word: Grant that your Church may love what he believed and preach what he taught;
    through Jesus Christ our Lord, who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, for
    ever and ever. **Amen.**
