st: easter day
tb: Almighty God, who through your only-begotten Son Jesus Christ overcame death and opened to us
    the gate of everlasting life: Grant that we, who celebrate with joy the day of the Lord’s
    resurrection, may, by your life-giving Spirit, be delivered from sin and raised from death;
    through Jesus Christ our Lord, who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, now
    and for ever. **Amen.**
