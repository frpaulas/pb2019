tb: Almighty God, you have surrounded us with a great cloud of witnesses: Grant that we, encouraged
    by the good example of your servant N., may persevere in running the race that is set before
    us, until at last, with him, we attain to your eternal joy; through Jesus Christ, the pioneer
    and perfecter of our faith, who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, for
    ever and ever. **Amen.**
