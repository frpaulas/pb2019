st: the second sunday in advent
tb: Blessed Lord, who caused all Holy Scriptures to be written for our learning: Grant us so to
    hear them, read, mark, learn, and inwardly digest them, that by patience and the comfort of
    your holy Word we may embrace and ever hold fast the blessed hope of everlasting life, which
    you have given us in our Savior Jesus Christ; who lives and reigns with you and the Holy
    Spirit, one God, for ever and ever. **Amen.**
