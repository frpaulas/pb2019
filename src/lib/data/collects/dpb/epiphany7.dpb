st: the seventh sunday of epiphany
tb: O God, the strength of all who put their trust in you: Mercifully accept our prayers, and
    because, through the weakness of our mortal nature, we can do no good thing without you, grant
    us the help of your grace, that in keeping your commandments we may please you both in will and
    deed; through Jesus Christ our Lord, who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one
    God, for ever and ever. **Amen.**
