st: of a martyr
tb: Almighty God, you gave your servant N. boldness to confess the Name of our Savior Jesus Christ
    before the rulers of this world, and courage to die for this faith: Grant that we may always be
    ready to give a reason for the hope that is in us, and to suffer gladly for the sake of our
    Lord Jesus Christ; who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and
    ever. **Amen.**
