tb: Almighty God, you gave to your apostles Philip and James the grace and strength to bear witness
    to Jesus as the way, the truth, and the life: Grant that we, being mindful of their victory of
    faith, may glorify in life and death the Name of our Lord Jesus Christ; who lives and reigns
    with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, now and for ever. **Amen.**
