tb: Almighty God, the giver of all good gifts, in your divine providence you have appointed various
    orders in your Church: Give your grace, we humbly pray, to all who are [now] called to any
    office and ministry for your people; and so fill them with the truth of your doctrine and
    clothe them with holiness of life, that they may faithfully serve before you, to the glory of
    your great Name and for the benefit of your holy Church; through Jesus Christ our Lord, who
    lives and reigns with you, in the unity of the Holy Spirit, one God, now and for ever.
    **Amen.**
