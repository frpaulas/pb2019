tb: O God, who for our redemption gave your only begotten Son to die upon the Cross, and by his
    glorious resurrection delivered us from the devil and the power of death: Grant us grace to die
    daily to sin, that we may live with him in the joy of his resurrection; who lives and reigns
    with you and the Holy Spirit, now and for ever. **Amen.**
