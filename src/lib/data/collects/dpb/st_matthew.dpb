tb: Lord Jesus, you called Matthew from collecting taxes to become your apostle and evangelist:
    Grant us the grace to forsake all covetous desires and inordinate love of riches, that we may
    follow you as he did and proclaim to the world around us the good news of your salvation; for
    with the Father and the Holy Spirit you live and reign, one God, now and for ever. **Amen.**
