st: a collect for sabbath rest
st: _Saturday_
tb: Almighty God, who after the creation of the world rested from all your works and sanctified a
    day of rest for all your creatures: Grant that we, putting away all earthly anxieties, may be
    duly prepared for the service of your sanctuary, and that our rest here upon earth may be a
    preparation for the eternal rest promised to your people in heaven; through Jesus Christ our
    Lord.
