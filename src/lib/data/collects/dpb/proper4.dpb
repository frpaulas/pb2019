tb: O God, the protector of all those who trust in you, without whom nothing is strong, nothing is
    holy: Increase and multiply upon us your mercy, that, with you as our ruler and guide, we may
    so pass through things temporal that we lose not the things eternal; grant this, heavenly
    Father, for the sake of your Son Jesus Christ, who lives and reigns with you and the Holy
    Spirit, one God, for ever and ever. **Amen.**
