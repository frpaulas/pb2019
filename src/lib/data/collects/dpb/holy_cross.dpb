tb: Almighty God, whose Son our Savior Jesus Christ was lifted high upon the Cross that he might
    draw the whole world to himself: Mercifully grant that we, who glory in the mystery of our
    redemption, may have grace to take up our cross and follow him; who lives and reigns with you
    and the Holy Spirit, one God, in glory everlasting. **Amen.**
