st: the fourth sunday of epiphany
tb: O God, you know that we are set in the midst of many grave dangers, and because of the frailty
    of our nature we cannot always stand upright: Grant that your strength and protection may
    support us in all dangers and carry us through every temptation; through Jesus Christ our Lord,
    who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and ever. **Amen.**
