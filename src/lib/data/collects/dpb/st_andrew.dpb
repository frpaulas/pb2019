tb: Almighty God, you gave such grace to your apostle Andrew that he readily obeyed the call of
    your Son Jesus Christ, and brought his brother with him: Give us, who are called by your holy
    Word, grace to follow him without delay, and to bring those near to us into his gracious
    presence; who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, now and for ever.
    **Amen.**
