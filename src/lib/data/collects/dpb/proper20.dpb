tb: O Lord, you have taught us that without love, all our deeds are worth nothing: Send your Holy
    Spirit and pour into our hearts that most excellent gift of charity, the true bond of peace and
    of all virtues, without which whoever lives is counted dead before you; grant this for the sake
    of your Son Jesus Christ, who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever
    and ever. **Amen.**
