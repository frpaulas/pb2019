tb: Almighty and merciful God, in your goodness keep us, we pray, from all things that may hurt us;
    that we, being ready both in mind and body, may accomplish with joyful hearts those things
    which belong to your purpose; through Jesus Christ our Lord, who lives and reigns with you and
    the Holy Spirit, one God, now and for ever. **Amen.**
