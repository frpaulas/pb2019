tb: O King and Judge of the nations: We remember before you with grateful hearts the men and women
    of our armed forces, who in the day of decision ventured much for the liberties we now enjoy;
    grant that we may not rest until all the people of this land share the benefits of true freedom
    and gladly accept its disciplines; through Jesus Christ our Lord, who with you and the Holy
    Spirit lives and reigns, now and for ever. **Amen.**
