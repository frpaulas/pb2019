tb: Almighty God, whose most dear Son went not up to joy but first he suffered pain, and entered
    not into glory before he was crucified: Mercifully grant that we, walking in the way of the
    Cross, may find it none other than the way of life and peace; through Jesus Christ your Son our
    Lord.
