st: the presentation of christ in the temple
st: February 2
tb: Almighty and everliving God, we humbly pray that, as your only-begotten Son was this day
    presented in the temple in the substance of our flesh, so we may be presented to you with pure
    and clean hearts by Jesus Christ our Lord; who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit,
    one God, now and for ever. **Amen.**
