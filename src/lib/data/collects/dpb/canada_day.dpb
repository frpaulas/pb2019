tb: Almighty God, whose wisdom and love are over all: Accept the prayers we offer for Canada, and
    give integrity to its citizens and wisdom to those in authority, that harmony and justice may
    be secured in obedience to your will; through Jesus Christ our Lord, who lives and reigns with
    you and the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and ever. **Amen.**
