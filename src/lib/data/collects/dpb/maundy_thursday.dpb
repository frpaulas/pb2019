tb: Almighty Father, whose most dear Son, on the night before he suffered, instituted the Sacrament
    of his Body and Blood: Mercifully grant that we may receive it in thankful remembrance of Jesus
    Christ our Savior, who in these holy mysteries gives us a pledge of eternal life; and who lives
    and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and ever. **Amen.**
