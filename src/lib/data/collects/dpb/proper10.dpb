tb: Let your merciful ears, O Lord, be open to the prayers of your humble servants; and, that we
    may receive what we ask, teach us by your Holy Spirit to ask only those things that are
    pleasing to you; through Jesus Christ our Lord, who with you and the same Spirit lives and
    reigns for ever and ever. **Amen.**
