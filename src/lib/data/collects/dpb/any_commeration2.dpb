tb: Almighty God, by your Holy Spirit you have made us one with your saints in heaven and on earth:
    Grant that in our earthly pilgrimage we may always be supported by this fellowship of love and
    prayer, and know ourselves to be surrounded by their witness to your power and mercy; for the
    sake of Jesus Christ, in whom all our intercessions are acceptable through the Spirit, and who
    lives and reigns with you and the same Spirit, one God, for ever and ever. **Amen.**
