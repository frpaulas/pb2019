st: saint james of jerusalem{br}_October 23_
tb: Grant, O God, that, following the example of your apostle James the Just, kinsman of our Lord,
    your Church may give itself continually to prayer and to the reconciliation of all who are at
    variance and enmity; through Jesus Christ our Lord, who lives and reigns with you and the Holy
    Spirit, one God, now and for ever. **Amen.**
