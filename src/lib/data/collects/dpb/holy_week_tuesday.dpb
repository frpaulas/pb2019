tb: O Lord our God, whose blessed Son gave his back to be whipped and did not hide his face from
    shame and spitting: Give us grace to accept joyfully the sufferings of the present time,
    confident of the glory that shall be revealed; through Jesus Christ our Lord, who lives and
    reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and ever. **Amen.**
