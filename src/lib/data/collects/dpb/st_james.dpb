tb: O gracious God, your servant and apostle James was first among the Twelve to suffer martyrdom
    for the Name of Jesus Christ: Pour out upon the leaders of your Church that spirit of
    self-denying service, by which they may have true authority among your people; through Jesus
    Christ our Lord, who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, now and for ever.
    **Amen.**
