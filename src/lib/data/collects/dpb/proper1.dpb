tb: O God, the strength of all who put their trust in you: Mercifully accept our prayers, and
    because, through the weakness of our mortal nature, we can do no good thing without you, grant
    us the help of your grace to keep your commandments, that we may please you in will and deed;
    through Jesus Christ our Lord, who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, for
    ever and ever. **Amen.**
