tb: Almighty God, we give you thanks for the ministry of N., who labored that the Church of Jesus
    Christ might be one: Grant that we, instructed by his teaching and example, and knit together
    in unity by your Spirit, may ever stand firm upon the one foundation, which is Jesus Christ our
    Lord; who lives and reigns with you, in the unity of the Holy Spirit, one God, now and for
    ever. **Amen.**
