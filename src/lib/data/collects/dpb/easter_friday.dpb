st: friday of easter week
tb: Almighty Father, who gave your only Son to die for our sins and to rise for our justification:
    Give us grace so to put away the leaven of malice and wickedness, that we may always serve you
    in purity of life; through Jesus Christ your Son our Lord, who lives and reigns with you and
    the Holy Spirit, one God, now and for ever. **Amen.**
