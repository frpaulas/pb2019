tb: O God, our refuge and strength, true source of all godliness: Graciously hear the devout
    prayers of your Church, and grant that those things which we ask faithfully, we may obtain
    effectually; through Jesus Christ our Lord, who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit,
    one God, now and for ever. **Amen.**
