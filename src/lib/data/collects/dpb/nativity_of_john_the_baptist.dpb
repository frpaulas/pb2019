st: the nativity of saint john the baptist{br}_June 24_
tb: Almighty God, by whose providence your servant John the Baptist was wonderfully born, and sent
    to prepare the way of your Son our Savior by preaching repentance: Make us so to follow his
    teaching and holy life, that we may truly repent, boldly rebuke vice, patiently suffer for the
    sake of truth, and proclaim the coming of Jesus Christ our Lord; who lives and reigns with you
    and the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and ever. **Amen.**
