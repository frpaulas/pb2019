l:b: O gladsome light,
l:b: pure brightness of the everliving Father in heaven, *
l:i:b: O Jesus Christ, holy and blessed!
l:b: Now as we come to the setting of the sun,
l:b: and our eyes behold the vesper light, *
l:i:b: we sing your praises, O God: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.
l:b: You are worthy at all times to be praised by happy voices, *
l:i:b: O Son of God, O Giver of Life,
l:i:b: and to be glorified through all the worlds.
