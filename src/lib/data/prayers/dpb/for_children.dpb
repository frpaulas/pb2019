st:1: for children
tb: O Lord Jesus Christ, who took little children into your arms
    and blessed them: Bless the children of this family, that they
    may grow up in godly fear and love. Give them your strength
    and guidance day by day, that they may continue in your love
    and service to their lives' end. Grant this, O blessed Savior, for
    your own Name's sake. **Amen.**
