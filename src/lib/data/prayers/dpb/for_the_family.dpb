st:1: for the family
tb: Merciful Savior, you loved Martha and Mary and Lazarus,
    hallowing their home with your sacred presence: Bless our
    home, we pray, that your love may rest upon us, and that your
    presence may dwell with us. May we all grow in grace and in
    the knowledge of you, our Lord and Savior. Teach us to love one
    another as you have commanded. Help us to bear one another's
    burdens in fulfillment of your law, O blessed Jesus, who with the
    Father and the Holy Spirit live and reign, one God, for ever and
    ever. **Amen.**
