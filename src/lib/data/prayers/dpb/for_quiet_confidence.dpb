st:1: for quiet confidence
tb: O God of peace, who hast taught us that in returning and rest
    we shall be saved, in quietness and in confidence shall be our
    strength: By the might of thy Spirit lift us, we pray thee, to thy
    presence, where we may be still and know that thou art God;
    through Jesus Christ our Lord. **Amen.**
