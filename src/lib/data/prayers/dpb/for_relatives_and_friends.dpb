st:1: for relatives and friends
tb: O Loving Father, we commend to your gracious keeping all
    who are near and dear to us. Have mercy upon any who are sick,
    and comfort those who are in pain, anxiety, or sorrow. Awaken
    all who are careless about eternal things. Bless those who
    are young and in health, that they may give the days of their
    strength to you. Comfort the aged and infirm, that your peace
    may rest upon them. Hallow the ties of kindred, that we may
    help and not hinder one another in all the good works that you
    have prepared for us to walk in; through Jesus Christ our Lord. **Amen.**
