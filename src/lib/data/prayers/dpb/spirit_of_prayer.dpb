st:1: for the spirit of prayer
tb: O Almighty God, you pour out on all who desire it the spirit
    of grace and of supplication: Deliver us, when we draw near to
    you, from coldness of heart and wanderings of mind, that with
    steadfast thoughts and kindled affections we may worship you in
    spirit and in truth; through Jesus Christ our Lord. **Amen.**
