	Almighty and everlasting God, you gave your apostle Bartholomew grace truly to believe and to
	preach your Word: Grant that your Church may love what he believed and preach what he taught;
	through Jesus Christ our Lord, who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, for
	ever and ever. **Amen.**</TextBlock
