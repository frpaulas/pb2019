	>O Lord Jesus Christ, you sent your messengers the prophets to preach repentance and prepare the
	way for our salvation: Grant that the ministers and stewards of your mysteries may likewise make
	ready your way, by turning the hearts of the disobedient toward the wisdom of the just, that at
	your second coming to judge the world, we may be found a people acceptable in your sight; for with
	the Father and the Holy Spirit you live and reign, one God, now and for ever. **Amen.**</TextBlock
