<TextBlock>
	Almighty God, you gave your servant N. boldness to confess the Name of our Savior Jesus Christ
	before the rulers of this world, and courage to die for this faith: Grant that we may always be
	ready to give a reason for the hope that is in us, and to suffer gladly for the sake of our Lord
	Jesus Christ; who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and ever.
	**Amen.**
