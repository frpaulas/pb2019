	Almighty God, by the hand of Mark the evangelist you have given to your Church the Gospel of Jesus
	Christ: We thank you for his witness, and pray that you will give us grace to know the truth, and
	not to be carried about by every wind of false doctrine, that we may know Jesus Christ as our Lord
	and Savior; who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and ever.
	**Amen.**</TextBlock
