	O Glorious Lord, your servant Stephen looked up to heaven and prayed for his persecutors: Grant
	that in all our sufferings here upon earth we may love and forgive our enemies, looking
	steadfastly to Jesus Christ our Lord, who sits at your right hand and intercedes for us; and who
	lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, now and for ever. **Amen.**
