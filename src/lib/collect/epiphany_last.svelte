	>O God, who before the passion of your only-begotten Son revealed his glory upon the holy
	mountain: Grant that we, beholding by faith the light of his countenance, may be strengthened to
	bear our cross, and be changed into his likeness from glory to glory; through Jesus Christ our
	Lord, who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and ever. **Amen.**</TextBlock
