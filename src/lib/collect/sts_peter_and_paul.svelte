	Almighty God, whose blessed apostles Peter and Paul glorified you by their martyrdom: Grant that
	your Church, instructed by their teaching and example, and knit together in unity by your Spirit,
	may ever stand firm upon the one foundation, which is Jesus Christ our Lord; who lives and reigns
	with you, in the unity of the Holy Spirit, one God, now and for ever. **Amen.**</TextBlock
