<TextBlock>
	Heavenly Father, you have delivered us from the dominion of sin and death, and brought us into the
	kingdom of your beloved Son: Grant that, as by his death he has called us to life, so by his love
	he may raise us to eternal joys; who lives and reigns with you, in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
	one God, now and for ever. **Amen.**</TextBlock
