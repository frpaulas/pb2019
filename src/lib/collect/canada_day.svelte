	Almighty God, whose wisdom and love are over all: Accept the prayers we offer for Canada, and give
	integrity to its citizens and wisdom to those in authority, that harmony and justice may be
	secured in obedience to your will; through Jesus Christ our Lord, who lives and reigns with you
	and the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and ever. **Amen.**
