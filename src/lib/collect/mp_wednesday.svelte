	O Lord, our heavenly Father, almighty and everlasting God, you have brought us safely to the
	beginning of this day: Defend us by your mighty power, that we may not fall into sin nor run into
	any danger; and that, guided by your Spirit, we may do what is righteous in your sight; through
	Jesus Christ our Lord.
