	Almighty God, by whose providence your servant John the Baptist was wonderfully born, and sent to
	prepare the way of your Son our Savior by preaching repentance: Make us so to follow his teaching
	and holy life, that we may truly repent, boldly rebuke vice, patiently suffer for the sake of
	truth, and proclaim the coming of Jesus Christ our Lord; who lives and reigns with you and the
	Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and ever. **Amen.**</TextBlock
