<TextBlock>
	O God, your blessed Son became poor for our sake, and chose the Cross over the kingdoms of this
	world: Deliver us from an inordinate love of worldly things, that we, inspired by the devotion of
	your servant N., may seek you with singleness of heart, behold your glory by faith, and attain to
	the riches of your everlasting kingdom, where we shall be united with our Savior Jesus Christ; who
	lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, now and for ever. **Amen.**
