	Almighty Father, who inspired Simon Peter, first among the apostles, to confess Jesus as Messiah
	and Son of the living God: Keep your Church steadfast upon the rock of this faith, that in unity
	and peace we may proclaim the one truth and follow the one Lord, our Savior Jesus Christ; who
	lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, now and for ever. **Amen.**</TextBlock
