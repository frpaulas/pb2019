	Almighty God, you gave to your apostles Philip and James the grace and strength to bear witness to
	Jesus as the way, the truth, and the life: Grant that we, being mindful of their victory of faith,
	may glorify in life and death the Name of our Lord Jesus Christ; who lives and reigns with you and
	the Holy Spirit, one God, now and for ever. **Amen.**</TextBlock
