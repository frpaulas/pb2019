<TextBlock>
	O Lord our God, whose blessed Son gave his back to be whipped and did not hide his face from shame
	and spitting: Give us grace to accept joyfully the sufferings of the present time, confident of
	the glory that shall be revealed; through Jesus Christ our Lord, who lives and reigns with you and
	the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and ever. **Amen.**</TextBlock
