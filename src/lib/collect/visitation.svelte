	Almighty God, by whose grace Elizabeth rejoiced with the blessed Virgin Mary and greeted her as
	the mother of the Lord: Look with favor on your lowly servants, that, with Mary, we may magnify
	your holy Name and rejoice to acclaim her Son as our Savior; who lives and reigns with you, in the
	unity of the Holy Spirit, one God, now and for ever. **Amen.**</TextBlock
