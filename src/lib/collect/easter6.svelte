	O God, you have prepared for those who love you such good things as surpass our understanding:
	Pour into our hearts such love towards you, that we, loving you in all things and above all
	things, may obtain your promises, which exceed all that we can desire; through Jesus Christ our
	Lord, who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and ever. **Amen.**</TextBlock
