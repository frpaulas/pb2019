	O Lord, from whom all good proceeds: Grant us the inspiration of your Holy Spirit, that we may
	always think those things that are good, and by your merciful guidance may accomplish the same;
	through Jesus Christ our Lord, who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, for
	ever and ever. **Amen.**</TextBlock
