	Grant us, Lord, not to be anxious about earthly things, but to love things heavenly; and even now,
	as we live among things that are passing away, to hold fast to those that shall endure; through
	Jesus Christ our Lord, who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and
	ever. **Amen.**</TextBlock
