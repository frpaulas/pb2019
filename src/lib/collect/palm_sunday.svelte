	>Almighty and everlasting God, in your tender love for us you sent your Son our Savior Jesus
	Christ to take upon himself our nature, and to suffer death upon the Cross, giving us the example
	of his great humility: Mercifully grant that we may walk in the way of his suffering, and come to
	share in his resurrection; through Jesus Christ our Lord, who lives and reigns with you and the
	Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and ever. **Amen.**</TextBlock
