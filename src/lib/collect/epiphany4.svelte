	>O God, you know that we are set in the midst of many grave dangers, and because of the frailty of
	our nature we cannot always stand upright: Grant that your strength and protection may support us
	in all dangers and carry us through every temptation; through Jesus Christ our Lord, who lives and
	reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and ever. **Amen.**</TextBlock
