	Let your merciful ears, O Lord, be open to the prayers of your humble servants; and, that we may
	receive what we ask, teach us by your Holy Spirit to ask only those things that are pleasing to
	you; through Jesus Christ our Lord, who with you and the same Spirit lives and reigns for ever and
	ever. **Amen.**</TextBlock
