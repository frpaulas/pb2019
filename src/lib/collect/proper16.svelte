	Let your continual mercy, O Lord, cleanse and defend your Church; and, because it cannot continue
	in safety without your help, protect and govern it always by your goodness; through Jesus Christ
	our Lord, who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and ever. **Amen.**</TextBlock
