	O God, our heavenly Father, you raised up your faithful servant N. to be a [Bishop and] pastor in
	your Church and to feed your flock: Give abundantly to all pastors the gifts of your Holy Spirit,
	that they may minister in your household as true servants of Christ and stewards of your divine
	mysteries; through Jesus Christ our Lord, who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one
	God, for ever and ever. **Amen.**
