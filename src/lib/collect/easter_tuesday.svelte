<TextBlock>
	O God, who by the glorious resurrection of your Son Jesus Christ destroyed death and brought life
	and immortality to light: Grant that we, who have been raised with him, may abide in his presence
	and rejoice in the hope of eternal glory; through Jesus Christ our Lord, to whom, with you and the
	Holy Spirit, be honor and glory, now and for ever. **Amen.**</TextBlock
