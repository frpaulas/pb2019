	Almighty and everlasting God, whose will it is to restore all things in your well-beloved Son, the
	King of kings and Lord of lords: Mercifully grant that the peoples of the earth, divided and
	enslaved by sin, may be freed and brought together under his most gracious rule; who lives and
	reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, now and for ever. **Amen.**</TextBlock
