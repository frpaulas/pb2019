	Keep your Church, O Lord, by your perpetual mercy; and because without you the frailty of our
	nature causes us to fall, keep us from all things hurtful, and lead us to all things profitable
	for our salvation; through Jesus Christ our Lord, who lives and reigns with you and the Holy
	Spirit, one God, for ever and ever. **Amen.**</TextBlock
