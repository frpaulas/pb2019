	>Almighty God, whose Son Jesus Christ in his earthly life shared our toil and hallowed our labor:
	Be present with your people where they work; make those who carry on the industries and commerce
	of this land responsive to your will; and give us all a right satisfaction in what we do, and a
	just return for our labor; through Jesus Christ our Lord, who lives and reigns with you, in the
	unity of the Holy Spirit, one God, now and for ever. **Amen.**</TextBlock
