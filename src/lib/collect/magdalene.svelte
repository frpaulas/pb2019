	Almighty God, whose blessed Son restored Mary Magdalene to health of body and of mind, and called
	her to be a witness of his resurrection: Mercifully grant that, by your grace, we may be healed
	from all our infirmities and know you in the power of his unending life; who with you and the Holy
	Spirit lives and reigns, one God, now and for ever. **Amen.**</TextBlock
