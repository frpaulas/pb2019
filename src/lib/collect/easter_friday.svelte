<TextBlock>
	Almighty Father, who gave your only Son to die for our sins and to rise for our justification:
	Give us grace so to put away the leaven of malice and wickedness, that we may always serve you in
	purity of life; through Jesus Christ your Son our Lord, who lives and reigns with you and the Holy
	Spirit, one God, now and for ever. **Amen.**</TextBlock
