	O God, the strength of all who put their trust in you: Mercifully accept our prayers, and because,
	through the weakness of our mortal nature, we can do no good thing without you, grant us the help
	of your grace to keep your commandments, that we may please you in will and deed; through Jesus
	Christ our Lord, who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and ever.
	**Amen.**</TextBlock
