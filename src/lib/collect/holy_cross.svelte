	Almighty God, whose Son our Savior Jesus Christ was lifted high upon the Cross that he might draw
	the whole world to himself: Mercifully grant that we, who glory in the mystery of our redemption,
	may have grace to take up our cross and follow him; who lives and reigns with you and the Holy
	Spirit, one God, in glory everlasting. **Amen.**</TextBlock
