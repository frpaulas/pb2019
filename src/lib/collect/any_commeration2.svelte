	>Almighty God, by your Holy Spirit you have made us one with your saints in heaven and on earth:
	Grant that in our earthly pilgrimage we may always be supported by this fellowship of love and
	prayer, and know ourselves to be surrounded by their witness to your power and mercy; for the sake
	of Jesus Christ, in whom all our intercessions are acceptable through the Spirit, and who lives
	and reigns with you and the same Spirit, one God, for ever and ever. **Amen.**
