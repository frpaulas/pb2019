	>Blessed Lord, who caused all Holy Scriptures to be written for our learning: Grant us so to hear
	them, read, mark, learn, and inwardly digest them, that by patience and the comfort of your holy
	Word we may embrace and ever hold fast the blessed hope of everlasting life, which you have given
	us in our Savior Jesus Christ; who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, for
	ever and ever. **Amen.**
