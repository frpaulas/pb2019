	>O God, you led your holy apostles to ordain ministers in every place: Grant that your Church,
	under the guidance of the Holy Spirit, may choose suitable persons for the ministry of Word and
	Sacrament, and may uphold them in their work for the extension of your kingdom; through the great
	Shepherd and Bishop of our souls, Jesus Christ our Lord, who lives and reigns with you and the
	Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and ever. **Amen.**</TextBlock
