	O God our King, by the resurrection of your Son Jesus Christ on the first day of the week, you
	conquered sin, put death to flight, and gave us the hope of everlasting life: Redeem all our days
	by this victory; forgive our sins, banish our fears, make us bold to praise you and to do your
	will; and steel us to wait for the consummation of your kingdom on the last great Day; through
	Jesus Christ our Lord.
