	O Lord, you never fail to support and govern those whom you bring up in your steadfast love and
	fear: Keep us, we pray, under your continual protection and providence, and give us a perpetual
	fear and love of your holy Name; through Jesus Christ our Lord, who lives and reigns with you and
	the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and ever. **Amen.**</TextBlock
