<TextBlock>
	Almighty God, who after the creation of the world rested from all your works and sanctified a day
	of rest for all your creatures: Grant that we, putting away all earthly anxieties, may be duly
	prepared for the service of your sanctuary, and that our rest here upon earth may be a preparation
	for the eternal rest promised to your people in heaven; through Jesus Christ our Lord.
</TextBlock>
