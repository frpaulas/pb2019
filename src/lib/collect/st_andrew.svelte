	Almighty God, you gave such grace to your apostle Andrew that he readily obeyed the call of your
	Son Jesus Christ, and brought his brother with him: Give us, who are called by your holy Word,
	grace to follow him without delay, and to bring those near to us into his gracious presence; who
	lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, now and for ever. **Amen.**</TextBlock
