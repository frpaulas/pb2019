	Almighty God, you have surrounded us with a great cloud of witnesses: Grant that we, encouraged by
	the good example of your servant N., may persevere in running the race that is set before us,
	until at last, with him, we attain to your eternal joy; through Jesus Christ, the pioneer and
	perfecter of our faith, who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and
	ever. **Amen.**
