<TextBlock>
	Stir up your power, O Lord, and with great might come among us; and as we are sorely hindered by
	our sins from running the race that is set before us, let your bountiful grace and mercy speedily
	help and deliver us; through Jesus Christ our Lord, to whom, with you and the Holy Spirit, be
	honor and glory, now and for ever. **Amen.**
