<TextBlock>
	O God, the King eternal, whose light divides the day from the night and turns the shadow of death
	into the morning: Drive far from us all wrong desires, incline our hearts to keep your law, and
	guide our feet into the way of peace; that, having done your will with cheerfulness during the
	day, we may, when night comes, rejoice to give you thanks; through Jesus Christ our Lord.
</TextBlock>
