<TextBlock>
	O gracious God, your servant and apostle James was first among the Twelve to suffer martyrdom for
	the Name of Jesus Christ: Pour out upon the leaders of your Church that spirit of self-denying
	service, by which they may have true authority among your people; through Jesus Christ our Lord,
	who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, now and for ever. **Amen.**</TextBlock
