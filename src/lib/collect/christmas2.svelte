	O God, who wonderfully created, and yet more wonderfully restored, the dignity of human nature:
	Grant that we may share the divine life of him who humbled himself to share our humanity, your Son
	Jesus Christ our Lord; who lives and reigns with you, in the unity of the Holy Spirit, one God,
	for ever and ever. **Amen.**</TextBlock
