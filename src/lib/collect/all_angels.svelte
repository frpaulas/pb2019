<TextBlock>
	Everlasting God, you have ordained and constituted in a wonderful order the ministries of angels
	and mortals: Mercifully grant that, as your holy angels always serve and worship you in heaven, so
	by your appointment they may help and defend us here on earth; through Jesus Christ our Lord, who
	lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and ever. **Amen.**</TextBlock
