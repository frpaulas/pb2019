	Almighty God, you have knit together your elect in one communion and fellowship in the mystical
	Body of your Son: Give us grace so to follow your blessed saints in all virtuous and godly living,
	that we may come to those ineffable joys that you have prepared for those who truly love you;
	through Jesus Christ our Lord, who with you and the Holy Spirit lives and reigns, one God, in
	glory everlasting. **Amen.**</TextBlock
