<TextBlock>
	Almighty God, give us grace to cast away the works of darkness, and put on the armor of light, now
	in the time of this mortal life in which your Son Jesus Christ came to visit us in great humility;
	that in the last day, when he shall come again in his glorious majesty to judge both the living
	and the dead, we may rise to the life immortal; through him who lives and reigns with you and the
	Holy Spirit, one God, now and for ever. Amen. Preface of Advent **Amen.**
