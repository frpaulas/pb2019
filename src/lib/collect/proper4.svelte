	O God, the protector of all those who trust in you, without whom nothing is strong, nothing is
	holy: Increase and multiply upon us your mercy, that, with you as our ruler and guide, we may so
	pass through things temporal that we lose not the things eternal; grant this, heavenly Father, for
	the sake of your Son Jesus Christ, who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, for
	ever and ever. **Amen.**</TextBlock
