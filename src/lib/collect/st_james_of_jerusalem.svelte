	Grant, O God, that, following the example of your apostle James the Just, kinsman of our Lord,
	your Church may give itself continually to prayer and to the reconciliation of all who are at
	variance and enmity; through Jesus Christ our Lord, who lives and reigns with you and the Holy
	Spirit, one God, now and for ever. **Amen.**</TextBlock
