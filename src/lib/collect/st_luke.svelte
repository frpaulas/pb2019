<TextBlock>
	Almighty God, you called your servant Luke to be an evangelist and physician of the soul: Grant
	that, by the wholesome medicine of the doctrine he taught, all the diseases of our souls may be
	healed; through Jesus Christ our Lord, who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God,
	now and for ever. **Amen.**</TextBlock
