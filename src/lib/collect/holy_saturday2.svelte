	>O God of the living, on this day your Son our Savior descended to the place of the dead: Look
	with kindness on all of us who wait in hope for liberation from the corruption of sin and death,
	and give us a share in the glory of the children of God; through Jesus Christ your Son our Lord.
	**Amen.**</TextBlock
