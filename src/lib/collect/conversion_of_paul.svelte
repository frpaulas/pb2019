<SectionTitle>_January 25_</SectionTitle>
<TextBlock>
	O God, by the preaching of your apostle Paul you have caused the light of the Gospel to shine
	throughout the world: Grant, we pray, that having his wonderful conversion in remembrance, we may
	show ourselves thankful to you by following his holy teaching; through Jesus Christ our Lord, who
	lives and reigns with you, in the unity of the Holy Spirit, one God, now and for ever. **Amen.**</TextBlock
