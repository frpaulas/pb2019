	O God, the author of peace and lover of concord, to know you is eternal life and to serve you is
	perfect freedom: Defend us, your humble servants, in all assaults of our enemies; that we, surely
	trusting in your defense, may not fear the power of any adversaries, through the might of Jesus
	Christ our Lord.
