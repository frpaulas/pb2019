<TextBlock>
	Most merciful Father, we humbly thank you for all your gifts so freely bestowed upon us: for life
	and health and safety, for strength to work and leisure to rest, for all that is beautiful in
	creation and in human life; but above all we thank you for our spiritual mercies in Christ Jesus
	our Lord; who with you and the Holy Spirit lives and reigns, one God, for ever and ever. **Amen.**
