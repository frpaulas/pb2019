<TextBlock>
	O God, by your grace your servant N., kindled by the flame of your love, became a burning and
	shining light in your Church, turning pride into humility and error into truth: Grant that we may
	be set aflame with the same spirit of love and discipline, and walk before you as children of
	light; through Jesus Christ our Lord, who lives and reigns with you, in the unity of the Holy
	Spirit, one God, now and for ever. **Amen.**
