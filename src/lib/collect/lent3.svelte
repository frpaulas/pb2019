	>Heavenly Father, you have made us for yourself, and our hearts are restless until they rest in
	you: Look with compassion upon the heartfelt desires of your servants, and purify our disordered
	affections, that we may behold your eternal glory in the face of Christ Jesus; who lives and
	reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and ever. **Amen.**</TextBlock
