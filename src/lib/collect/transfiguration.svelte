<TextBlock>
	O God, who on the holy mount revealed to chosen witnesses your well-beloved Son, wonderfully
	transfigured, in raiment white and glistening: Mercifully grant that we, being delivered from the
	disquietude of this world, may by faith behold the King in his beauty; who with you and the Holy
	Spirit lives and reigns, one God, for ever and ever. **Amen.**</TextBlock
