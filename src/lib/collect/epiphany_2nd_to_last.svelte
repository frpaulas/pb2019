	>Almighty God, through the outpouring of the Holy Spirit, you revealed the way of eternal life to
	every race and nation: Pour out this gift anew, that by the preaching of the Gospel your salvation
	may reach to the ends of the earth; through Jesus Christ our Lord, who lives and reigns with you,
	in the unity of the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and ever. **Amen.**</TextBlock
