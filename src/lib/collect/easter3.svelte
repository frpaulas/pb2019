<TextBlock>
	Almighty God, you gave your only Son to be for us both a sacrifice for sin and an example of godly
	living: Give us grace thankfully to receive his inestimable benefits, and daily to follow the
	blessed steps of his most holy life; through Jesus Christ our Lord, who lives and reigns with you
	and the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and ever. **Amen.**</TextBlock
