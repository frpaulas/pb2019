	O King and Judge of the nations: We remember before you with grateful hearts the men and women of
	our armed forces, who in the day of decision ventured much for the liberties we now enjoy; grant
	that we may not rest until all the people of this land share the benefits of true freedom and
	gladly accept its disciplines; through Jesus Christ our Lord, who with you and the Holy Spirit
	lives and reigns, now and for ever. **Amen.**</TextBlock
