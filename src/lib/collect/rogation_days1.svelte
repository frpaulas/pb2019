	>Almighty God, Lord of heaven and earth: We humbly pray that your gracious providence may give and
	preserve to our use the harvests of the land and of the seas, and may prosper all who labor to
	gather them, that we, who are constantly receiving good things from your hand, may always give you
	thanks; through Jesus Christ our Lord, who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God,
	for ever and ever. **Amen.**</TextBlock
