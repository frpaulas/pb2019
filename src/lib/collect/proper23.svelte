	O God, our refuge and strength, true source of all godliness: Graciously hear the devout prayers
	of your Church, and grant that those things which we ask faithfully, we may obtain effectually;
	through Jesus Christ our Lord, who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, now and
	for ever. **Amen.**</TextBlock
