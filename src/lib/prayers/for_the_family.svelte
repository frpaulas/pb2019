home, we pray, that your love may rest upon us, and that your
presence may dwell with us. May we all grow in grace and in
the knowledge of you, our Lord and Savior. Teach us to love one
another as you have commanded. Help us to bear one another’s
burdens in fulfillment of your law, O blessed Jesus, who with the
Father and the Holy Spirit live and reign, one God, for ever and
ever."
