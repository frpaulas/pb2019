<SectionTitle text="the exhortation" />
<TextBlock
	text="Dearly beloved in the Lord: if you intend to come to the Holy
Communion of the Body and Blood of our Savior Jesus Christ,
you must consider how Saint Paul, in his First Letter to the
Corinthians, exhorts us all diligently to examine ourselves before
we presume to eat of that Bread, and drink of that Cup. For as
the benefit is great, if we receive that holy Sacrament with a
truly penitent heart and lively faith, spiritually eating the Flesh
of Christ and drinking his Blood, so that we might be made
one with Christ and he with us; so also is the danger great, if
we receive these gifts unworthily. For then we become guilty of
profaning the Body and Blood of Christ our Savior, and we eat
and drink to our own condemnation."
/>
<TextBlock
	text="Therefore, judge yourselves lest you be judged by the Lord.
First, examine your life by the rule of God’s commandments.
Wherever you have offended, either by thought, word, or deed,
confess your sins to Almighty God, with the full intention to
amend your life. Be ready to make restitution for all injuries
and wrongs you have done to others; and also be ready to
forgive others who have offended you: for otherwise, if you
unworthily receive Holy Communion, you will increase your
own condemnation. Therefore, repent of your sins, or else do not
come to God’s Holy Table."
