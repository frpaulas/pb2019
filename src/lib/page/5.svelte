	here. The Book of Common Prayer (2019) is indisputably true to Cranmerâ€™s originating vision of a
	form of prayers and praises that is thoroughly Biblical, catholic in the manner of the early
	centuries, highly participatory in delivery, peculiarly Anglican and English in its roots,
	culturally adaptive and missional in a most remarkable way, utterly accessible to the people, and
	whose repetitions are intended to form the faithful catechetically and to give them doxological
	voice."

<TextBlock

	The Book of Common Prayer (2019) is the product of the new era of reform and restoration that has
	created the Anglican Church in North America. The Jerusalem Declaration of 2008 located itself
	within the historic confines of what is authentically the Christian Faith and the Anglican
	patrimony, and sought to restore their fullness and beauty. The Book of Common Prayer (2019) is
	offered to the same end."
