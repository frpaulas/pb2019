	text="In the absence of a Priest, the Bishop may, at his discretion,
authorize a Deacon to distribute Holy Communion to the
Congregation from consecrated Bread and Wine. In this
situation, the Deacon may say all that is appointed through the
Offertory, though the Deacon may not pronounce an absolution
after the Confession. After the Offertory, the Deacon reverently
places the consecrated Sacrament on the Holy Table. The
Deacon then leads the people in the Lord’s Prayer. Omitting the
breaking of the bread, the Deacon proceeds with the rest of the
liturgy. There is no blessing at the end of the liturgy."
