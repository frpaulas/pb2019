<TextBlock
	text="The Holy Communion, commonly called the Lord’s Supper
or the Holy Eucharist, is a chief means of grace for sustained
and nurtured life in Christ. It is normally the principal
service of Christian worship on the Lord’s Day and on other
appointed Feasts and Holy Days. Mindful of the admonition
in 1 Corinthians 11:27-29, participation in Holy Communion
requires a penitent heart and lively faith."
/>
<TextBlock
	text="Holy Baptism is the initiatory rite of the Church, which seals
adoption in Christ and is the means of grace for new life in him.
Confirmation (or Reception) through the laying on of hands by a
Bishop is the rite of public profession of faith that is expected of
every adult member of the Church. In it the Holy Spirit gives grace
to the believer for discipleship and ministry as a mature Christian."
/>
<TextBlock
	text="In addition to these liturgies and the other rites contained in
this Book, the Minister, subject to the direction of the Ordinary
(Diocesan Bishop), may use other forms of occasional service set
forth by authority within this Church. Special devotions taken
from Holy Scripture, and other services consistent with the
Scriptures, may be authorized by the Bishop."
/>
<TextBlock
	text="The entire Congregation participates in the conduct of public
worship. Laity, Deacons, Presbyters, and Bishops fulfill the
functions of their respective orders. Because divine service should
give the Lord the worship due his Name, the Church expects
proper training of all who lead in the liturgies of the Church."

<TextBlock
	text="As pastoral need arises or local circumstance requires, all services
may be translated into languages other than English for the sake
of those gathered for worship. Similarly, any service contained in
this Book may have the contemporary idiom of speech conformed
to the traditional language (thou, thee, thy, thine, etc.) of earlier
Prayer Books. Likewise, the ordering of Communion rites may
be conformed to a historic Prayer Book ordering."
