<TextBlock
	text="Daily Morning Prayer and Daily Evening Prayer are the
established rites (offices) by which, both corporately and
individually, Godâ€™s people annually encounter the whole of the
Holy Scriptures, daily confess their sins and praise Almighty
God, and offer timely thanksgivings, petitions, and intercessions.
The Prayer Book tradition has historically expected clergy to
pray the Daily Office morning and evening each day."

<TextBlock
	text="The Great Litany is commonly used before the Holy Eucharist
on the First Sunday of Advent and the First Sunday in Lent, and
may be used on other Sundays as needed or as the Bishop directs.
The Great Litany is especially appropriate for Rogation days,
other days of fasting or thanksgiving, and occasions of solemn
and comprehensive entreaty. It can be used as an independent
rite, or at the conclusion of Morning or Evening Prayer."
