<Line bold>Today, if you will hear his voice, harden not your hearts *</Line>
<Line bold indent>as in the provocation, and as in the day of temptation in</Line>
<Line bold indent>the wilderness,</Line>
<Line bold>When your fathers tested me, *</Line>
<Line bold indent>and put me to the proof, though they had seen my works.</Line>
<Line bold>Forty years long was I grieved with this generation and said, *</Line>
<Line bold indent>“It is a people that err in their hearts,</Line>
<Line bold indent>for they have not known my ways,”</Line>
<Line bold>Of whom I swore in my wrath *</Line>
<Line bold indent>that they should not enter into my rest.</Line>

<Line bold>O be joyful in the Lord, all you lands; *</Line>
<Line indent bold>serve the Lord with gladness,</Line>
<Line indent bold>and come before his presence with a song.</Line>
<Line bold>Be assured that the Lord, he is God; *</Line>
<Line indent bold>it is he that has made us, and not we ourselves;</Line>
<Line indent bold>we are his people, and the sheep of his pasture.</Line>
<Line bold>O go your way into his gates with thanksgiving,</Line>
<Line bold>and into his courts with praise; *</Line>
<Line indent bold>be thankful unto him, and speak good of his Name.</Line>
<Line bold>For the Lord is gracious, his mercy is everlasting, *</Line>
<Line indent bold>and his truth endures from generation to generation.</Line>
