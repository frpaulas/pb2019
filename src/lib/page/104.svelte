	text="Holy Communion is normally the principal service of Christian
worship on the Lord’s Day, and on other appointed Feasts and
Holy Days. Two forms of the liturgy, commonly called the
Lord’s Supper or the Holy Eucharist, are provided."

<TextBlock
	text="The Anglican Standard Text is essentially that of the Holy
Communion service of the Book of Common Prayer of 1662 and
successor books through 1928, 1929, and 1962. The Anglican
Standard Text is presented in contemporary English and in
the order for Holy Communion that is common, since the late
twentieth century, among ecumenical and Anglican partners
worldwide. The Anglican Standard Text may be conformed to
its original content and ordering, as in the 1662 or subsequent
books; the Additional Directions give clear guidance on how
this is to be accomplished. Similarly, there are directions given
as to how the Anglican Standard Text may be abbreviated where
appropriate for local mission and ministry."

<TextBlock
	text="The Renewed Ancient Text is drawn from liturgies of the Early
Church, reflects the influence of twentieth century ecumenical
consensus, and includes elements of historic Anglican piety.
A comprehensive collection of Additional Directions concerning
Holy Communion is found after the Renewed Ancient Text."
