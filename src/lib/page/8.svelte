<TextBlock>When nouns, pronouns, and their verbs are italicized because of
their number, singular may be changed to plural and vice versa
as the situation requires. A black line in the left margin of the
page indicates that the material in that section may be used at
the discretion of the Minister.</TextBlock>
<TextBlock>Hymns, anthems, and songs of praise must be in the words of
Holy Scripture, or of the Book of Common Prayer, or congruent
with them. The local Minister is responsible for maintaining
this standard. Where rubrics indicate that a part of the service
is to be “said,” it must be understood to include “or sung,” and
vice versa. When it is desired to use music composed for them,
previously authorized liturgical texts may be used in place of
the corresponding texts in this Book. Throughout this Book,
asterisks ( * ) are used to denote the responsorial, antiphonal, or
musical break points in canticles and other texts frequently sung
or corporately recited.</TextBlock>
<TextBlock>Quotations of Scripture in this Book Of Common Prayer (2019)
normally follow The Holy Bible: English Standard Version (esv)
except for the Psalms and Canticles, and for citations marked
with the symbol ( t ) which indicates traditional prayer book
language. Similarly, the symbol ( v ) indicates that verse
numbers of a particular psalm of the New Coverdale Psalter
found in this book differ from other translations. This Psalter
is a renewal of the Coverdale Psalter of 1535, whose meter and
turn of phrase remain embedded in the global Anglican heritage
of language and music.</TextBlock>
