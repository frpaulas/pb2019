<TextBlock amen>Keep watch, dear Lord, with those who work, or watch, or weep
this night, and give your angels charge over those who sleep.
Tend the sick, Lord Christ; give rest to the weary, bless the
dying, soothe the suffering, pity the afflicted, shield the joyous;
and all for your love’s sake.</TextBlock>
<OrThis />
<TextBlock amen>O God, your unfailing providence sustains the world we live in
and the life we live: Watch over those, both night and day, who
work while others sleep, and grant that we may never forget that
our common life depends upon each other’s toil; through Jesus
Christ our Lord.</TextBlock>
<Rubric>Silence may be kept, and other intercessions and thanksgivings may be offered.</Rubric>
