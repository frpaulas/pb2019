	Christianity—the fullness of the good news about Jesus Christ—came very early to what would
	eventually be called Anglia (England) through the witness of soldiers, sailors, merchants, and
	missionaries. Legend holds that the biblical tomb-giver, Joseph of Arimathea, was among the first
	of those scattered evangelists."

	The early Christian mission in the British Isles was an encounter with pagan tribes and societies.
	Converts banded together, and in this context communities of common prayer, learning, and
	Christ-like service emerged, living under agreed rules. Thus “monasteries” became centers of the
	evangelization of this remote region of the Roman world, and ever more so as the empire
	disintegrated. Early heroes and heroines leading such communities bore names that are still
	remembered and celebrated, names like Patrick, Brigid, David, Columba, Cuthbert, and Hilda.
	Haphazardly, and without a centralized hierarchy or authority, what emerged in Britain, by God’s
	grace, was a Church that saw herself, in each of her local manifestations, as part of the One,
	Holy, Catholic, and Apostolic Church: culturally attuned and missionally adaptive, but ever
	committed to and always propagating “the faith that was once for all delivered to the saints”
	(jude 1:3)."
