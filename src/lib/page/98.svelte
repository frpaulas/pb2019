<TextBlock amen>Look mercifully, O Father, on our infirmities; and, for the glory
of your Name, rescue us from all those evils we now endure; and
grant that in all our troubles we may put our whole trust and
confidence in your mercy, serving you in holiness and purity of
life, to your honor and glory; through our only Mediator and
Advocate, Jesus Christ our Lord.</TextBlock>
