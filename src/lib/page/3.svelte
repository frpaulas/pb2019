	worship all that was “contrary to Holy Scripture or to the ordering of the Primitive Church.” The
	Book of Common Prayer, from the first edition of 1549, became the hallmark of a Christian way of
	worship and believing that was both catholic and reformed, continuous yet always renewing.
	According to this pattern, communities of prayer—congregations and families rather than the

	For a century, the Church of England matured and broadened as a tradition separated from the
	Church of Rome. Its pastoral, musical, and ascetical life flourished: Jeremy Taylor, Lancelot
	Andrewes, Thomas Tallis, William Byrd, and George Herbert are but a few of the names associated
	with this flowering. Also begun were three centuries of colonial expansion that exported the Book
	of Common Prayer to countless cultures and people- groups the world over."

	The English Civil War of the seventeenth century drove the Church of England and her liturgy
	underground. Nevertheless, with the Restoration of the Monarchy, the Book of Common Prayer,

	Anglicans independent of the British Crown, challenged and re-shaped Prayer Book worship, as would
	the East African revival, charismatic renewal, and the dissolution of Empire in the 20th century.
	Similarly, the evangelical and anglo-catholic movements of the 19th century profoundly affected
	Anglican self-understanding and worship in different, often seemingly contradictory, ways; yet the
	Book of Common Prayer (1662) was common to every period of this"
