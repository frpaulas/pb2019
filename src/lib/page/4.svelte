	development. For nearly five centuries, Cranmer’s Prayer Book idea had endured to shape what
	emerged as a global Anglican Church that is missional and adaptive as in its earliest centuries;

	The liturgical movement of the 20th century and the ecumenical rapprochement in the second half of
	that century had an immense impact on the Prayer Book tradition. The Book of Common Prayer (1979)
	in the United States and various Prayer Books that appeared in Anglican Provinces from South
	America to Kenya to South East Asia to New Zealand were often more revolutionary than evolutionary
	in character. Eucharistic prayers in particular were influenced by the re-discovery of patristic
	texts unknown at the Reformation, and often bore little resemblance to what had for centuries been
	the Anglican norm. Baptismal theology, especially in North America, was affected by radical
	revisions to the received Christian understanding, and came perilously close to proclaiming a
	gospel of individual affirmation rather than of personal transformation and sanctification."

	At the beginning of the 21st century, global reassessment of the Book of Common Prayer of 1662 as
	“the standard for doctrine, discipline, and worship” shapes the present volume, now presented on
	the bedrock of its predecessors. Among the timeless treasures offered in this Prayer Book is the
	Coverdale Psalter of 1535 (employed with every Prayer Book from the mid-16th to the mid-20th
	centuries), renewed for contemporary use through efforts that included the labors of 20th century
	Anglicans T. S. Eliot and C. S. Lewis, and brought to final form"
