	The liturgical movement of the 20th century and the ecumenical rapprochement in the second half of

	America to Kenya to South East Asia to New Zealand were often more revolutionary than evolutionary
	in character. Eucharistic prayers in particular were influenced by the re-discovery of patristic
	texts unknown at the Reformation, and often bore little resemblance to what had for centuries been
	the Anglican norm. Baptismal theology, especially in North America, was affected by radical
	revisions to the received Christian understanding, and came perilously close to proclaiming a
	gospel of individual affirmation rather than of personal transformation and sanctification.</TextBlock>

	“the standard for doctrine, discipline, and worship” shapes the present volume, now presented on
	the bedrock of its predecessors. Among the timeless treasures offered in this Prayer Book is the
	Coverdale Psalter of 1535 (employed with every Prayer Book from the mid-16th to the mid-20th
