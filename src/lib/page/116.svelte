<TextBlock
	text="All praise and glory is yours, O God our heavenly Father, for
in your tender mercy, you gave your only Son Jesus Christ to
suffer death upon the Cross for our redemption. He made
there, by his one oblation of himself once offered, a full, perfect,
and sufficient sacrifice, oblation, and satisfaction, for the sins
of the whole world; and he instituted, and in his Holy Gospel
commanded us to continue, a perpetual memory of his precious
death and sacrifice, until his coming again."
/>
<TextBlock
	text="So now, O merciful Father, in your great goodness, we ask you to
bless and sanctify, with your Word and Holy Spirit, these gifts of
bread and wine, that we, receiving them according to your Son
our Savior Jesus Christ’s holy institution, in remembrance of his
death and passion, may be partakers of his most blessed Body
and Blood. †"

<Rubric
	text="At the following words concerning the bread, the Celebrant is to hold it, or lay
a hand upon it, and here* may break the bread; and at the words concerning the
cup, to hold or place a hand upon the cup and any other vessel containing the wine
to be consecrated."

<TextBlock
	text="For on the night that he was betrayed, our Lord Jesus Christ
took bread; and when he had given thanks, he broke it,* and
gave it to his disciples, saying, “Take, eat; this is my Body, which
is given for you: Do this in remembrance of me.”"

<TextBlock
	text="Likewise, after supper, Jesus took the cup, and when he had
given thanks, he gave it to them, saying, “Drink this, all of you;
for this is my Blood of the New Covenant, which is shed for
you, and for many, for the forgiveness of sins: Whenever you
drink it, do this in remembrance of me.” ‡"
