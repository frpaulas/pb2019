	text="If the Priest knows that a person who is living a notoriously evil
life intends to come to Communion, the Priest shall privately
instruct that person not to come to the Lord’s Table until he
or she has given clear proof of repentance and amendment of
life. The Priest shall follow the same procedure with those who
have done wrong to their neighbors and are a scandal to the
other members of the Congregation, not allowing such persons
to receive Communion until they have made restitution for the
wrong they have done."

<TextBlock
	text="When the Priest sees that there is enmity between members
of the Congregation, the Priest shall speak privately to each of
them, telling them that they may not receive Communion until
they have forgiven each other. And if the person or persons
on one side truly forgive the others and desire and promise to
make up for their faults, but those on the other side refuse to
forgive, the Priest shall allow those who are penitent to come to
Communion, but not those who are obstinate."

soon as possible (within fourteen days at the most) giving the
reasons for refusing Communion."
