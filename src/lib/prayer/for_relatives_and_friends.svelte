who are near and dear to us. Have mercy upon any who are sick,
and comfort those who are in pain, anxiety, or sorrow. Awaken
all who are careless about eternal things. Bless those who
are young and in health, that they may give the days of their
strength to you. Comfort the aged and infirm, that your peace
may rest upon them. Hallow the ties of kindred, that we may
help and not hinder one another in all the good works that you
have prepared for us to walk in; through Jesus Christ our Lord."
