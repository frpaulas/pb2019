<Rubric>Silence is kept. All kneeling, the Officiant and People say</Rubric>
<Line bold>Almighty and most merciful Father,</Line>
<Line indent bold>we have erred and strayed from your ways like lost sheep.</Line>
<Line bold>We have followed too much the devices and desires</Line>
<Line indent bold>of our own hearts.</Line>
<Line bold>We have offended against your holy laws.</Line>
<Line bold>We have left undone those things which we ought to have done,</Line>
<Line indent bold>and we have done those things which we ought not</Line>
<Line indent bold>to have done;</Line>
<Line bold>and apart from your grace, there is no health in us.</Line>
<Line bold>O Lord, have mercy upon us.</Line>
<Line bold>Spare all those who confess their faults.</Line>
<Line bold>Restore all those who are penitent, according to your promises</Line>
<Line indent bold>declared to all people in Christ Jesus our Lord.</Line>
<Line bold>And grant, O most merciful Father, for his sake,</Line>
<Line indent bold>that we may now live a godly, righteous, and sober life,</Line>
<Line indent bold>to the glory of your holy Name. Amen.</Line>
