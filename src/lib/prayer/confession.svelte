<Line>Let us humbly confess our sins to Almighty God.</Line>
<Rubric>Silence is kept. All kneeling, the Officiant and People say</Rubric>
<Line bold>Almighty and most merciful Father,</Line>
<Line indent bold>: we have erred and strayed from your ways like lost sheep.</Line>
<Line bold>We have followed too much the devices and desires</Line>
<Line indent bold>: of our own hearts.</Line>
<Line bold>We have offended against your holy laws.</Line>
<Line bold>We have left undone those things which we ought to have done,</Line>
<Line indent bold>: and we have done those things which we ought not</Line>
<Line indent bold>: to have done;</Line>
<Line bold>and apart from your grace, there is no health in us.</Line>
<Line bold>O Lord, have mercy upon us.</Line>
<Line bold>Spare all those who confess their faults.</Line>
<Line bold>Restore all those who are penitent, according to your promises</Line>
<Line indent bold>: declared to all people in Christ Jesus our Lord.</Line>
<Line bold>And grant, O most merciful Father, for his sake,</Line>
<Line indent bold>: that we may now live a godly, righteous, and sober life,</Line>
<Line indent bold>: to the glory of your holy Name. Amen.</Line>

<TextBlock>
	Almighty God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, desires not the death of sinners, but that they
	may turn from their wickedness and live. He has empowered and commanded his ministers to pronounce
	to his people, being penitent, the absolution and remission of their sins. He pardons and absolves
	all who truly repent and genuinely believe his holy Gospel. For this reason, we beseech him to
	grant us true repentance and his Holy Spirit, that our present deeds may please him, the rest of
	our lives may be pure and holy, and that at the last we may come to his eternal joy; through Jesus
	Christ our Lord. __Amen.__

	The Almighty and merciful Lord grant you absolution and remission of all your sins, true
	repentance, amendment of life, and the grace and consolation of his Holy Spirit. __Amen.__

	Grant to your faithful people, merciful Lord, pardon and peace; that we may be cleansed from all
	our sins, and serve you with a quiet mind; through Jesus Christ our Lord. __Amen.__
