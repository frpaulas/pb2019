<Line bold>Almighty and everliving God,</Line>
<Line bold>we thank you for feeding us, in these holy mysteries,</Line>
<Line indent bold>with the spiritual food of the most precious Body and Blood</Line>
<Line indent bold>of your Son our Savior Jesus Christ;</Line>
<Line bold>and for assuring us, through this Sacrament, of your favor and</Line>
<Line indent bold>goodness towards us:</Line>
<Line indent bold>that we are true members of the mystical body of your Son,</Line>
<Line indent bold>the blessed company of all faithful people;</Line>
<Line indent bold>and are also heirs, through hope,</Line>
<Line indent bold>of your everlasting kingdom.</Line>
<Line bold>And we humbly ask you, heavenly Father,</Line>
<Line indent bold>to assist us with your grace,</Line>
<Line indent bold>that we may continue in that holy fellowship,</Line>
<Line indent bold>and do all the good works that you have prepared for us to</Line>
<Line indent bold>walk in;</Line>
<Line bold>through Jesus Christ our Lord,</Line>
<Line indent bold>to whom, with you and the Holy Spirit,</Line>
<Line indent bold>be all honor and glory, now and for ever. Amen.</Line>
