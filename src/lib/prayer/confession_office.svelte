<SectionTitle>confession of sin</SectionTitle>
<Rubric>The Officiant says to the People</Rubric>
<TextBlock>
	Dearly beloved, the Scriptures teach us to acknowledge our many sins and offenses, not concealing
	them from our heavenly Father, but confessing them with humble and obedient hearts that we may
	obtain forgiveness by his infinite goodness and mercy. We ought at all times humbly to acknowledge
	our sins before Almighty God, but especially when we come together in his presence to give thanks
	for the great benefits we have received at his hands, to declare his most worthy praise, to hear
	his holy Word, and to ask, for ourselves and on behalf of others, those things which are necessary
	for our life and our salvation. Therefore, draw near with me to the throne of heavenly grace.

<Rubric>The Priest alone stands and says</Rubric>
<TextBlock>
	Almighty God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, desires not the death of sinners, but that they
	may turn from their wickedness and live. He has empowered and commanded his ministers to pronounce
	to his people, being penitent, the absolution and remission of their sins. He pardons and absolves
	all who truly repent and genuinely believe his holy Gospel. For this reason, we beseech him to
	grant us true repentance and his Holy Spirit, that our present deeds may please him, the rest of
	our lives may be pure and holy, and that at the last we may come to his eternal joy; through Jesus
	Christ our Lord. __Amen.__
