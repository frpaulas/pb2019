<Line bold>Most merciful God,</Line>
<Line indent bold>we confess that we have sinned against you</Line>
<Line indent bold>in thought, word and deed,</Line>
<Line indent bold>by what we have done, and by what we have left undone.</Line>
<Line bold>We have not loved you with our whole heart;</Line>
<Line indent bold>we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.</Line>
<Line bold>We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.</Line>
<Line bold>For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,</Line>
<Line indent bold>have mercy on us and forgive us;</Line>
<Line indent bold>that we may delight in your will, and walk in your ways,</Line>
<Line indent bold>to the glory of your Name. Amen.</Line>
