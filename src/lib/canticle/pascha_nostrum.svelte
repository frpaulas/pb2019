<SectionTitle fancy>Christ our Passover</SectionTitle>

<Line bold>Alleluia. Christ our Passover has been sacrificed for us; *</Line>
<Line indent bold>therefore let us keep the feast,</Line>
<Line bold>Not with the old leaven, the leaven of malice and evil, *</Line>
<Line indent bold>but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth. Alleluia.</Line>
<Line bold>Christ being raised from the dead will never die again; *</Line>
<Line indent bold>death no longer has dominion over him.</Line>
<Line bold>The death that he died, he died to sin, once for all; *</Line>
<Line indent bold>but the life he lives, he lives to God.</Line>
<Line bold>So also consider yourselves dead to sin, *</Line>
<Line indent bold>and alive to God in Jesus Christ our Lord. Alleluia.</Line>
<Line bold>Christ has been raised from the dead, *</Line>
<Line indent bold>the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep.</Line>
<Line bold>For since by a man came death, *</Line>
<Line indent bold>by a man has come also the resurrection of the dead.</Line>
<Line bold>For as in Adam all die, *</Line>
<Line indent bold>so also in Christ shall all be made alive. Alleluia.</Line>
