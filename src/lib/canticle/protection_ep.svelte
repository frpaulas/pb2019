<TextBlock amen>
	O God, the life of all who live, the light of the faithful, the strength of those who labor, and
	the repose of the dead: We thank you for the blessings of the day that is past, and humbly ask for
	your protection through the coming night. Bring us in safety to the morning hours; through him who
	died and rose again for us, your Son our Savior Jesus Christ.
