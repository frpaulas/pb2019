<SectionTitle fancy>The Song of Mary</SectionTitle>
<Line bold>My soul magnifies the Lord, *</Line>
<Line indent bold>and my spirit rejoices in God my Savior;</Line>
<Line indent bold>For he has regarded *</Line>
<Line bold>the lowliness of his handmaiden.</Line>
<Line indent bold>For behold, from now on, *</Line>
<Line bold>all generations will call me blessed;</Line>
<Line indent bold>For he that is mighty has magnified me, *</Line>
<Line bold>and holy is his Name.</Line>
<Line indent bold>And his mercy is on those who fear him, *</Line>
<Line bold>throughout all generations.</Line>
<Line indent bold>He has shown the strength of his arm; *</Line>
<Line bold>he has scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts.</Line>
<Line indent bold>He has brought down the mighty from their thrones, *</Line>
<Line bold>and has exalted the humble and meek.</Line>
<Line indent bold>He has filled the hungry with good things, *</Line>
<Line bold>and the rich he has sent empty away.</Line>
<Line indent bold>He, remembering his mercy, has helped his servant Israel, *</Line>
<Line bold>as he promised to our fathers, Abraham and his seed for ever.</Line>
<Gloria />
