<Line bold>Seek the Lord while he wills to be found; *</Line>
<Line indent bold>call upon him when he draws near.</Line>
<Line bold>Let the wicked forsake their ways *</Line>
<Line indent bold>and the evil ones their thoughts;</Line>
<Line bold>And let them turn to the Lord, and he will have compassion, *</Line>
<Line indent bold>and to our God, for he will richly pardon.</Line>
<Line bold>For my thoughts are not your thoughts, *</Line>
<Line indent bold>nor your ways my ways, says the Lord.</Line>
<Line bold>For as the heavens are higher than the earth, *</Line>
<Line indent bold>so are my ways higher than your ways,</Line>
<Line indent bold>and my thoughts than your thoughts.</Line>
<Line bold>For as rain and snow fall from the heavens *</Line>
<Line indent bold>and return not again, but water the earth,</Line>
<Line bold>Bringing forth life and giving growth, *</Line>
<Line indent bold>seed for sowing and bread for eating,</Line>
<Line bold>So is my word that goes forth from my mouth; *</Line>
<Line indent bold>it will not return to me empty;</Line>
<Line bold>But it will accomplish that which I have purposed, *</Line>
<Line indent bold>and prosper in that for which I sent it.</Line>
<Line bold>Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit; *</Line>
<Line indent bold>as it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be,</Line>
<Line indent bold ref="isaiah 55:6-11">world without end. Amen.</Line>
